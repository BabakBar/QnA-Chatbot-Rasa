text_1 = ["Totally this bot is a usable, it mean is clear and easy to use.  The structure and purpose of the product can be evaluated for aim of collecting relevant information regarding a doctoral program. Yes, it was surprisingly accurate!. Yes, I found something but in general I dont feel good talking with a robot :). Yes. Yes it was accurate but I think get better in the future. I assume the answers are all correct, but it seems the answers are not stored in the robot, but only the paths do. Anyway it tells something about where to find information, that's nice. Not absolutely. For example: When I asked about course content, the bot replied with a link on supervisor's researches.Somehow It is really impresive and useful to guide through the informations given.Yes. Yes. Its at the very basic stage and is not doing a complete registration process. For now, its answering just 2 questions. Yes. I liked it when it provided a small description and links.a good implementation for a search query bot.The bot is quite accurate. It gave me the information I was looking for and the response was super fast. I think implementing this chatbot would save time to professionals because they don't need to answer emails/requests from candidates and it would give a support to PhD candidates.  It would also push candidates to apply because they would be impressed by chatbots' efficiency. In most cases the provided information is relevant but not detailed enough."]
